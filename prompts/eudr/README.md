# EUDR Operational Prompts

This directory contains operational prompts for EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation) compliance workflows.

## Purpose

Prompts in this directory are procedural instructions for GitHub Copilot to:
- Set up EUDR processing infrastructure
- Initialize data pipelines
- Execute compliance checks
- Generate reports

## Current Prompts

- (to be populated with specific EUDR operational prompts)

## Usage

These prompts are designed to be:
1. **Read by Copilot** as structured instructions
2. **Reviewed by humans** before execution
3. **Host-aware** (adapt to Mac mini vs laptop environment)
4. **Idempotent** where possible (safe to rerun)

## Naming Convention

- `setup_*.md` - Infrastructure and environment setup
- `run_*.md` - Execution and processing workflows
- `validate_*.md` - Testing and validation procedures
- `troubleshoot_*.md` - Debugging and recovery procedures
