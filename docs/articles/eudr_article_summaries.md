# EUDR Article Summaries (Non-verbatim)

These summaries are short, non-verbatim orientation notes for implementers and auditors.

Authoritative text is the hashed EUR-Lex artefacts recorded in [docs/regulation/sources.md](../regulation/sources.md) and [docs/regulation/sources.json](../regulation/sources.json) once acquired.

## Article 9 — Information requirements
- Focus: what information must be collected and retained to demonstrate compliant sourcing.
- Typical themes: identifying products/commodities, origin/production details, and traceability information needed to support downstream due diligence.
- Audit intent: ensure the evidence bundle captures required inputs and provenance needed to substantiate claims.

## Article 10 — Risk assessment
- Focus: assessing the risk that products are linked to prohibited outcomes (e.g., deforestation/illegality) using available information.
- Typical themes: combining source data, checks, and contextual risk signals into a reasoned assessment outcome.
- Audit intent: confirm decision logic is evidence-backed, reproducible, and that uncertainty/limitations are recorded.

## Article 11 — Risk mitigation
- Focus: actions and controls to address risks identified by the assessment.
- Typical themes: applying additional controls, seeking further information, constraining sourcing, or other mitigation steps until risk is acceptable.
- Audit intent: confirm mitigation actions are traceable to risks and supported by documented evidence.
